# Voice Controlled Robot 

A Voice Controlled Robot developed using Arduino Nano, Bluetooth module HC05, Android application which was developed using MIT app inventor (It is an online platform which enables us to develop android apps without coding, using a drag and drop facility). Steps to build your own app is given in this repository. 

It accepts basic commands such as move forward, go back, turn right, turn left, stop. These commands can be edited in arduino code given in this repository.

Hardware Requirements:- Arduino Nano, Bluetooth module HC05, L293D Motor Driver, DC Motors, Chassis, Wires, Breadboard

Software Requirements:- Android application, Arduino IDE
